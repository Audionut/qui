# qBittorrent WebUI Implementation Progress

## Overview
This document tracks the implementation progress of the qBittorrent Alternative WebUI project as outlined in `prd_final.md`.

## Phase 1: Project Setup and Infrastructure (Days 1-3)

### Day 1 Progress

#### Completed Tasks
- [x] Created progress.md to track implementation
- [x] Initialized Go module with `go mod init github.com/s0up4200/qbitweb`
- [x] Installed core backend dependencies (chi, viper, cobra, zerolog, sqlite)
- [x] Created project directory structure
- [x] Created basic main.go, router.go, config.go, and db.go files
- [x] Created README.md
- [x] Created Vite project with React TypeScript template
- [x] Created Makefile for build automation
- [x] Created .air.toml for hot reload development

#### To Do
- [ ] Complete shadcn/ui initialization (alias issue)
- [ ] Create database migrations
- [ ] Implement basic API handlers
- [ ] Set up frontend routing

#### Completed Today
- [x] All Go dependencies successfully installed (gorilla/sessions, autobrr/go-qbittorrent, ristretto, ants/v2)
- [x] React 19 installed (already included in Vite template)
- [x] All TanStack libraries installed (@tanstack/react-router, react-query, react-table, react-virtual, react-form)
- [x] Tailwind CSS v4 installed and configured with Vite plugin
- [x] Import alias configured in tsconfig and vite.config

#### Current Status
Phase 1 is nearly complete. All dependencies are installed and the project structure is in place. The shadcn/ui initialization is having issues with the import alias detection, but this can be worked around by manually installing components. The project is ready to move into Phase 2 (Core Backend Implementation).
