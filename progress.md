- **Settings**: Password change, API key management, account information

### Current Status
Phase 3 is complete! The frontend is fully implemented with all core features:
- Dynamic routing for instance selection
- High-performance torrent table with virtual scrolling
- Real-time updates using SyncMainData
- Complete torrent management capabilities
- User settings and API key management

### Phase 4: Authentication & Integration Fixes ✅

### Completed Tasks
- [x] Fixed authentication redirect flow for initial setup
- [x] Implemented proper setup detection and routing
- [x] Added Vite proxy configuration for API calls during development
- [x] Fixed RequireSetup middleware to allow setup check endpoint
- [x] Resolved database is_active flag synchronization with client health status
- [x] Fixed qBittorrent instance connection status tracking

- **Development Setup**: Proper API proxying between frontend and backend during development

### Phase 5: Frontend Embedding (Days 13-14)
- Web handler implementation
- Build process integration
- Single binary distribution

### Phase 6: Performance Optimization (Days 15-16) ✅

### Completed Tasks
- [x] Fixed TanStack Router routing inconsistency - `/instances/1` now properly shows torrent table
- [x] Implemented server-side pagination with proper page/offset conversion in backend
- [x] Added server-side search functionality across torrent name, category, and tags
- [x] Fixed torrent stats calculation - stats bar now shows correct counts matching pagination
- [x] Created `GetTorrentsWithSearch` method with proper caching and stats calculation

- [x] Implemented proper torrent state constants matching go-qbittorrent library
- [x] Added debounced search (500ms) for improved user experience

### Key Features Implemented
- **Server-Side Operations**: All pagination, sorting, and filtering now handled by backend
- **Performance Optimization**: Only loads 50 torrents per page instead of all 1000+
- **Accurate Stats**: Stats bar shows correct torrent counts from server-side calculation
- **Efficient Search**: Server-side search with proper filtering and caching
- **Responsive UI**: Browser remains responsive when handling large datasets (10k+ torrents)

### Current Status
Phase 6 is complete! Performance optimization has been successfully implemented:
- Server-side pagination prevents loading all torrents at once
- Accurate stats calculation from backend with proper filtering
- Efficient search functionality with minimal page flashing
- Optimal performance for 10k+ torrents as specified in PRD
- Proper caching and debouncing for smooth user experience
