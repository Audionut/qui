# qBittorrent WebUI Implementation Progress

## Overview
This document tracks the implementation progress of the qBittorrent Alternative WebUI project as outlined in `prd_final.md`.

## Phase 1: Project Setup and Infrastructure (Days 1-3)

### Day 1 Progress

#### Completed Tasks
- [x] Created progress.md to track implementation
- [x] Initialized Go module with `go mod init github.com/s0up4200/qbitweb`
- [x] Installed core backend dependencies (chi, viper, cobra, zerolog, sqlite)
- [x] Created project directory structure
- [x] Created basic main.go, router.go, config.go, and db.go files
- [x] Created README.md
- [x] Created Vite project with React TypeScript template
- [x] Created Makefile for build automation
- [x] Created .air.toml for hot reload development

#### To Do
- [ ] Add remaining Go dependencies (gorilla/sessions, autobrr/go-qbittorrent, ristretto, ants/v2)
- [ ] Install React 19 and frontend dependencies
- [ ] Configure Tailwind CSS v4
- [ ] Initialize shadcn/ui

#### Current Status
The basic project structure is in place. Go dependencies are partially installed and appear in go.mod after creating files that import them. Next steps involve completing the dependency installation and setting up the frontend with React 19 and the TanStack libraries.
