# qBittorrent WebUI Implementation Progress

## Overview
This document tracks the implementation progress of the qBittorrent Alternative WebUI project as outlined in `prd_final.md`.

## Phase 1: Project Setup and Infrastructure (Days 1-3) ✅

### Completed Tasks
- [x] Created progress.md to track implementation
- [x] Initialized Go module with `go mod init github.com/s0up4200/qbitweb`
- [x] Installed all backend dependencies
- [x] Created complete project directory structure
- [x] Created Vite project with React TypeScript template
- [x] Installed all frontend dependencies
- [x] Created Makefile for build automation
- [x] Created .air.toml for hot reload development

## Phase 2: Core Backend Implementation (Days 4-7) ✅

### Completed Tasks
- [x] Created database schema and migrations for user, api_keys, and instances tables
- [x] Implemented database models (user.go, api_key.go, instance.go)
- [x] Complete configuration system with Viper (defaults, env vars, config file)
- [x] Implemented authentication system with session management
- [x] Created auth service with argon2 password hashing
- [x] Implemented qBittorrent client pool and connection management
- [x] Created sync manager for SyncMainData support
- [x] Implemented API handlers for auth endpoints
- [x] Implemented API handlers for instance management
- [x] Implemented API handlers for torrent operations
- [x] Set up middleware (auth, CORS, logging)
- [x] Complete router setup with all API routes
- [x] Updated main.go to wire everything together

### Key Features Implemented
- **Database**: SQLite with embedded migrations, WAL mode for performance
- **Authentication**: Single-user setup with session-based auth and API key support
- **Configuration**: Viper-based with environment variables (QBITWEB__ prefix) and TOML config
- **qBittorrent Integration**: Connection pooling, health checks, SyncMainData support
- **API**: RESTful endpoints for auth, instances, and torrent management
- **Performance**: Ristretto cache, ants goroutine pool, optimized for 10k+ torrents

### Current Status
Phase 2 is complete! The backend is fully implemented with all core features:
- Database layer with migrations
- Authentication and authorization
- qBittorrent client management with connection pooling
- SyncMainData implementation for efficient updates
- Complete API with all planned endpoints
- Middleware for security and logging
- Configuration management with hot-reload support
